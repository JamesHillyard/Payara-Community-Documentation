= JMX Monitoring Notifiers Configuration

JMX Monitoring can be configured to send notifications using the notification service.
This allows you to forward data from exposed MBeans to your configured
notifiers.

== Configuration

The JMX Monitoring configuration page can be found under *Configurations* ->
`<config-name>` -> *Monitoring*.

The JMX page allows you to specify the time between notifications, how
notifications will be delivered, and the MBeans which will be included within
the message.
