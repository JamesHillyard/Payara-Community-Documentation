[[jmx-monitoring-service]]
= JMX Monitoring

Payara offers a custom JMX Monitoring Service. Once configured, Payara
Server Community will monitor and log the values of attributes that have been listed
for monitoring. The metrics are logged together in a single log message as
a series of key-value pairs prefixed by the string `JMX-MONITORING:`.

[[enable-jmx]]
== Enabling JMX Monitoring

IMPORTANT: Payara uses the AMX API for working with _JMX MBeans_. AMX is not fully
exposed by default and as such needs to be loaded to access most _JMX MBean_
objects. The JMX Monitoring Service can be used without AMX but
there is a limit to what can be monitored without it.


[[boot-amx]]
=== Boot AMX

To boot AMX at startup or independently from the JMX Monitoring service, run the 
command below: 
[source, shell]
----
asadmin>set-amx-enabled --enabled true --dynamic true --target server 
----

[[using-web-admin-console]]
=== Boot AMX Using the Admin Console

image:jmx-monitoring-service/enable_amx.png[Enable AMX]

You can now enable JMX Monitoring using the `set-jmx-monitoring-configuration` asadmin command

JMX Monitoring can either be enabled for next startup or the service can be dynamically 
enabled on a running instance of Payara (provided a non-empty configuration exists 
at server startup). To enable the service dynamically on the default running 
instance of Payara the command to run is:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-jmx-monitoring-configuration --dynamic true --enabled true
----

To enable the service for next startup the `--dynamic` option would need
to be dropped from the command.

[[get-jmx-config]]
== Getting The JMX Monitoring Configuration

*Usage*::
`asadmin> get-jmx-monitoring-configuration --pretty false|true`

*Aim*::
Retrieves the monitoring service configuration and outputs it.

[[configure-jmx]]
== Setting The JMX Monitoring Configuration

You can configure JMX Monitoring using the `set-jmx-monitoring-configuration` asadmin command.

[[adding-the-monitoring-attribute]]
=== Adding a monitoring attribute

To add the `HeapMemoryUsage` attribute to the list of MBean attributes to monitor 
using the service the following command can be used:

[source, shell]
-----
asadmin> set-jmx-monitoring-configuration --addattribute 'attributeName=HeapMemoryUsage 
objectName=java.lang:type=Memory' --enabled false
-----

Breaking this command down, two arguments have been used:

* `--addattribute`
* `--enabled`

Passing `--addattribute` to `set-jmx-monitoring-configuration` provides a way to 
add a new **MBean** attribute to monitor using the service. This argument takes 
in a string of space-delimited key-value pairs corresponding to the values listed 
earlier. The `attributeName` and `objectName` fields are required, but `description` 
is not. Providing `attributeName=HeapMemoryUsage` denotes that the name of the 
**MBean** attribute to log is `HeapMemoryUsage`, while `objectName=java.lang:type=Memory` 
denotes the `ObjectName` of the **MBean** to look for the attribute on is `java.lang:type=Memory`.

The second argument, `--enabled`, is the only required option for the `asadmin` 
command. The only valid values to give this option are `true` or `false`. Passing 
`false` to the option will disable the logging service on next startup if it is 
currently enabled, but will otherwise do nothing. Under this scenario the monitoring 
service has not been configured yet so `false` was passed.

[[dealing-with-composite-mbean-attributes]]
=== Dealing with composite MBean attributes

The **MBean** attribute added, `HeapMemoryUsage`, is a composite attribute.

It has metrics for the `commited`, `init`, `max` and `used` attributes. The 
monitoring service will by default monitor each metric and log it as 
`{$metric}{$attribute_name}:{$attribute_value}`.

If this is not the desired result, it is possible to monitor a single metric for
 a composite **MBean** attribute. To monitor a single metric for the attribute 
the value of `attributeName` passed to the `--addattribute` option should be modified like so:

----
attributeName=HeapMemoryUsage.metric
----

So to log only the used heap memory the asadmin command would be:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-jmx-monitoring-configuration --addattribute 'attributeName=HeapMemoryUsage.used 
objectName=java.lang:type=Memory' --enabled false
----

[[setting-logging-frequency]]
=== Setting logging frequency

There are two configuration attributes related to the frequency at which log 
messages are written: `logfrequency` and `logfrequencyunit`. The first is a 
numerical value used for the rate, while the second is the unit for the rate. 
The default configuration is set to have a message logged every _15 seconds_.

If the value of `logfrequencyunit` is the default of `SECONDS` then to
have the monitoring service log messages every one minute execute the following command:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-jmx-monitoring-configuration --logfrequency 60 --enabled false
----
