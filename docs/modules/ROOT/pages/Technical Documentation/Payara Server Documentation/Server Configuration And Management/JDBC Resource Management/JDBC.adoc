Java Database Connectivity is a Java API used for managing connections to a database. This page will detail specific features related to the use of JDBC Connections.

[[configuring-a-connection-pool]]
== Configuring a Connection Pool

A connection pool is a store of database connections that can be used and (more importantly) re-used to connect to a RDBMS database. They help to improve both the performance and scalability of the system.

Rather than creating a new connection each time one is needed a pool of logical connections is created when Payara Server is started. When a new connection is required the pool is searched for an available connection. If one is available it is returned to the requester. If none is available then the request is either queued or a new connection is established depending on how many connections are already in the pool and how the pool is configured.

Once the connection is finished with, rather than closing it the connection is returned to the connection pool for use by the next requester.

[[creating-the-connection-pool]]
=== Creating a connection pool

It is possible to create a JDBC connection pool on the web administration console, or using administration commands.

[[using-admin-console]]
==== Using Admin Console

In the left hand panel of the Admin console go to _Resources_ -> _JDBC_ -> _JDBC Connection Pools_

Click the _New_ button and enter the following values:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Setting Name |Value
|Pool Name |test-pool
|Resource Type |`javax.sql.DataSource`
|Driver Vendor |(value for the driver, e.g. Derby30 for a Derby DB, MySQL for a MySQL DB)
|=======================================================================

Click Next and then click Finish on the next screen, accepting the default values.

image:connection-pools/connection_pools_1.png[New JDBC Connection Pool]

Add the following properties to the connection pool by going to the _Additional Properties_ tab of the connection pool:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Setting name |Value |Description
|PortNumber |3306 |Database port
|Password |`mypassword` |Database password
|User |root |Database user
|serverName |localhost |Database address
|DatabaseName |test |Name of the database
|connectionAttributes | |Other connection attributes (supported by the JDBC driver)
|=======================================================================

image:connection-pools/connection_pools_2.png[Connection pool properties]

To test the connection attributes, go back to the _General_ tab and click the _Ping_ button at the top of the screen. You should see a message stating that the ping succeeded.

[[using-asadmin]]
==== Using administration commands

You can also create a JDBC connection pool using the `asadmin` command line tool with the following options:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> create-jdbc-connection-pool --datasourceclassname com.mysql.jdbc.jdbc2.optional.MysqlDataSource --restype javax.sql.DataSource --property user=root:password=test:DatabaseName=test:ServerName=localhost:port=3306 test-pool
----

With this command, you need to specify the full name of the driver's class instead of just selecting a value from a drop-down menu.

You can test the connection to the database from the command line run the following command:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> ping-connection-pool test-pool
----

[[jdbc-call-logging-sql-tracing]]
== JDBC Call Logging (SQL Tracing)
:page-aliases:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/advanced-jdbc/log-jdbc-calls.adoc

WARNING: This is a feature best used for development purposes due to the volume of trace data that is produced.

SQL calls made through a JDBC connection pool can be traced, with the time taken to execute the call also recorded. SQL Tracing is ideal for debugging those hard to pin down performance issues during the development phase and as all SQL is visible SQL tracing is also a great way to see the SQL generated out of your JPA code.

[[enabling-jdbc-call-logging]]
== Enabling JDBC Call Logging

With *Log JDBC Calls* configured on the connection call each call into the connection pool is timed and logged to the server log at the `FINE` level. A typical log message with Log JDBC Enabled is shown below;

[source, log]
----
[#|2016-02-04T18:51:01.467+0000|FINE|Payara 5.2021.5|javax.enterprise.resource.sqltrace.com.sun.gjc.util|_ThreadID=35;_ThreadName=http-listener-1(5);_TimeMillis=1454611861467;_LevelValue=500;ClassName=com.sun.gjc.util.SQLTraceLogger;MethodName=sqlTrace;|

----

[[jdbc-call-logging-administration-console]]
=== Using the Administration Console

SQL Tracing can be enabled through the Payara Server Web administration console. First, navigate to the advanced table of your JDBC connection pool, then select the _JDBC > JDBC Connection pools > ${Your Connection pool}_.

Then select the *Advanced Tab* in the main window of the administration console. Then select the checkbox next to *Log JDBC Calls* to enable logging of all SQL calls:

image:advanced-jdbc/logjdbccall.png[Enabling SQL Tracing in the administration console]

[[asadmin-command-line-interface]]
=== Using Asadmin Commands

The *Log JDBC Calls* setting for a JDBC connection pool can also be configured via asadmin using the `set` command to set the `fish.payara.log-jdbc-calls` property of your connection pool to `true`, like in the following example:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin set domain.resources.jdbc-connection-pool.__TimerPool.log-jdbc-calls=true
----

[[jdbc-call-logging-deployment]]
== Application Deployment

In Java EE 7+ applications and above, a JDBC data source can be deployed by adding the `@DataSourceDefinition` annotation to  a managed component (like and `@Stateless` EJB bean for example). The *Log JDBC Calls* setting can be configured using this annotation as well:

[source, java]
----
@DataSourceDefinition(
    name = "java:app/MyApp/MyDS",
    className = "org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource",
    url = "jdbc:h2:mem:test",
    properties = {"fish.payara.log-jdbc-calls=true"})
----

The Data source definition can also be added to a deployment descriptor of an application, for example in the _web.xml_ standard deployment descriptor:

[source, xml]
----
<data-source>
   <name>java:global/ExampleDataSource</name>
   <class-name>com.mysql.jdbc.jdbc2.optional.MysqlXADataSource</class-name>
   <server-name>localhost</server-name>
   <port-number>3306</port-number>
   <database-name>mysql</database-name>
   <user>test</user>
   <password>test</password>
   <!-- Example of how to use a Payara specific custom connection pool setting -->
   <property>
       <name>fish.payara.log-jdbc-calls</name>
       <value>true</value>
   </property>
</data-source>
----

or in the definition of a `jdbc-connection-pool` in a __payara-resources.xml__ file:
[source, xml]
----
<jdbc-connection-pool name="examplePool"
        res-type="javax.sql.DataSource"
        datasource-classname="org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource" log-jdbc-calls="true">
    <property name="user" value="test"/>
    <property name="password" value="test"/>
    <property name="url" value="java:global/ExampleDataSource"/>
</jdbc-connection-pool>

----

This can also be done in the creation of a JDBC Connection Pool with the `--logjdbccalls` option.

[source, shell]
----
asadmin create jdbc-connection-pool --datasourceclassname org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource --restype javax.sql.XADataSource --logjdbccalls=true examplePool
----

[[advance-connection-pool-properties-in-deployment-descriptors]]
== Advanced Connection Pool Properties in Deployment Descriptors
:page-aliases:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/advanced-jdbc/advanced-connection-pool-properties.adoc

Payara Server supports setting advanced JDBC connection pool properties directly on data source definitions made with the `@DataSourceDefinition` annotation or directly on deployment descriptors.

[[setting-properties-in-the-deployment-descriptor]]
=== Setting Properties in the Deployment Descriptor

In a Java EE 7+ application, a data source definition can be added to a deployment descriptor of an application. For a web application, you would this in the standard _web.xml_ deployment descriptor. To set advanced properties just add a `property` element as shown in the following example:

[source, xml]
----
<data-source>
    <name>java:global/ExampleDataSource</name>
    <class-name>com.mysql.jdbc.jdbc2.optional.MysqlXADataSource</class-name>
    <server-name>localhost</server-name>
    <port-number>3306</port-number>
    <database-name>mysql</database-name>
    <user>test</user>
    <password>test</password>
    <!-- Example of how to use a Payara specific custom connection pool setting -->
    <property>
       <name>fish.payara.is-connection-validation-required</name>
       <value>true</value>
    </property>
</data-source>
----

[[setting-properties-via-annotations.]]
=== Setting Properties on the `@DataSourceDefinition` Annotation.

In Java EE 7+ applications, a JDBC data source can be deployed by adding the `@DataSourceDefinition` annotation to  a managed component (like and `@Stateless` EJB bean for example). To configure advanced JDBC properties, use the `properties` attribute of the annotation to define an array of the properties to configure:

[source, java]
----
@DataSourceDefinition(
    name = "java:app/MyApp/MyDS",
    className = "org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource",
    url = "jdbc:h2:mem:test",
    properties = {"fish.payara.is-connection-validation-required=true"})
----

[[example-datasource-configuration]]
== Example Data Source Configuration

An example data source configured on the _web.xml_ and deployed with a custom *SQL Trace Listener* is shown below. This data source is configured to also validate all connections returned from the connection pool before giving them to the application using the built-in _MySQL_ *Connection Validation* class. The data source is also configured to log any queries that exceed **5** seconds and also logs ALL JDBC statements:
