. Any commands listed will also be written assuming that the system environment variables have been set up to have Java on the system Path.

The owning class of an API method will not be explicitly stated unless it is not clear if an instance has been started or not; methods that operate on Payara Micro instances before they have been bootstrapped (instances that have not yet been started) are contained in the `PayaraMicro` class, whereas methods that operate on bootstrapped instances (running instances) are contained within the `PayaraMicroRuntime` class.
