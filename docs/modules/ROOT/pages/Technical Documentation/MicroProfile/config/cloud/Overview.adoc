The Cloud Config Sources can be used to extract configuration properties from a secret store or a database of several different cloud providers. The following Cloud Config Sources are currently available:

- xref:/Technical Documentation/MicroProfile/Config/Cloud/AWS.adoc[AWS Secrets Manager]
- xref:/Technical Documentation/MicroProfile/Config/Cloud/Azure.adoc[Azure Secrets]
- xref:/Technical Documentation/MicroProfile/Config/Cloud/Dynamo DB.adoc[DynamoDB Database]
- xref:/Technical Documentation/MicroProfile/Config/Cloud/GCP.adoc[GCP Secret Manager]
- xref:/Technical Documentation/MicroProfile/Config/Cloud/Hashicorp.adoc[Hashicorp Secrets]

## Configuration

Each of the cloud configuration sources are disabled by default, but can be configured dynamically or statically like any other Payara service. The configuration commands and options can be found in the respective cloud config source page.
