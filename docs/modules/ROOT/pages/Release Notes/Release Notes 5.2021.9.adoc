= Release Notes - Payara Platform Community 5.2021.9

== Supported APIs and Applications

* Jakarta EE 8
* Java EE 8 Applications
* Jakarta EE 9
* MicroProfile 4.1

== Notes

Payara Platform Community 5.2021.9, runs on JDK 17 but there might be corner cases that are not covered yet. We encourage everyone interested in an upgrade to JDK 17 to perform additional testing in their test or acceptance environment on JDK 17.

=== Breaking Changes

==== TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 Disabled within Docker

The JDK version within the Docker images is upgraded to 8u312 and 11.0.13 respectively.  These versions have the TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 protocol disabled by default as they are considered insecure nowadays. This will only affect if your application creates sockets and defines the TLS version explicitly. There is no problem when calling a remote endpoint using https unless that remote service does not support version 1.2 or higher of the TLS protocol.
