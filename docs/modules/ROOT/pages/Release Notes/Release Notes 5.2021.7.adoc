=== Security Vulnerability

IMPORTANT:  We recently discovered and fixed an important security vulnerability within the Payara Server and Payara Micro products. A path Traversal security issue was found when the application is deployed under the root context which allowed a hacker to read from the file system of the server running the application. We highly recommend that you upgrade to this version to avoid the security issue.

We'd like to thank _Thibaud Kehler_ and _Oliver Maicher_ from SySS GmbH who reported this vulnerability to the Payara team via the security@payara.fish email address as instructed in xref:Security/Overview.adoc#reporting-security-issues[Reporting Security Issues].
